## Welcome to my portfolio!

Hello. I'm Jesse, an engineer with expertise modeling fluids and  combustion. I'm also skilled at statistical analysis and interested in data science. 

Much of the professional work I’ve done is unfortunately proprietary, so I’m showcasing side projects and some work from my master’s degree here.

Please see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessedumas/) for details on my professional work. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work with me. 

### Patent Applications

I'm an inventor on a few [patent applications](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=dumas&assignee=clearsign).

### Climate Modeling

This graduate level course focused on principles of Earth system modeling. Topics emphasized atmosphere, ocean sea ice, and land-surface impacts on climate. Here's some of my work from the class:

I [modeled global ocean temperature anomalies](jesdumas.github.io/atm559/dumas_atm559_hw1.pdf) using a simple model written in Python. 

I [analyzed data](jesdumas.github.io/atm559/dumas_atm559_hw2.pdf) from a climate model with a flattened Antarctica (which has some [high elevation mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinson_Massif)).  

I [investigated heat transfer](jesdumas.github.io/atm559/dumas_atm559_hw4.pdf) in the ocean using the [Large Ensemble Community Project](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/LENS/). 

For my final project, I chose to teach myself about [data assimilation](jesdumas.github.io/atm559/dumas_atms559project.pdf).


### Computational Methods for Data Analysis


In this applied math course, I studied statistical learning and its underlying linear algebra. Check out these projects:

[Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): Foundations for Facial Recognition](jesdumas.github.io/amath582/amath582hw1.pdf)

[Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Finding System Dynamics in Noisy Videos](jesdumas.github.io/amath582/amath582hw2.pdf)

[Music Genre Classifier using PCA and Naive Bayes](jesdumas.github.io/amath582/amath582hw3.pdf)

[Separating Foreground and Background Video using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)](jesdumas.github.io/amath582/amath582hw4.pdf)

[Using DMD to Track Structures in Simulated Turbulent Flows](jesdumas.github.io/amath582/amath582project2.pdf)

### Master's Thesis

My [thesis](jesdumas.github.io/thesisdata/dumas_ms_thesis.pdf) focused on calculating drag coefficients for a supersonic projectile in a [ram accelerator](https://www.aa.washington.edu/research/ramaccel/introduction), a novel space launch concept.
