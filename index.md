## Welcome to my portfolio!

Much of the analytical work I've done (computaional fluid dynamics, chemical kinetics modeling, statistical learning on experimental data) is unfortunately propriertary. However, I'm showcasing side projects and some work from my master's degree here.

Please see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessedumas/) for details on my professional work. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work with me.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jesdumas/jesdumas.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
