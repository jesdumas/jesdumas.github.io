## Welcome to my portfolio!

Hello. I'm Jesse, an engineer with expertise modeling fluids and  combustion. I'm also skilled at statistical analysis. 

Much of the analytical work I’ve done is unfortunately proprietary, so I’m showcasing side projects and some work from my master’s degree here.

Please see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessedumas/) for details on my professional work. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work with me. 

### Patent Applications

I'm an inventor on a few [patent applications](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=dumas&assignee=clearsign).

### Climate Modeling

This graduate level course focused on principles of Earth system modeling. Topics emphasized atmosphere, ocean sea ice, and land-surface impacts on climate. Here's some of my work from the class:

I [modeled global ocean temperature anomalies](jesdumas.github.io/atm559/dumas_atm559_hw1.pdf) using a simple model written in Python. 

I [analyzed data](jesdumas.github.io/atm559/dumas_atm559_hw2.pdf) from a climate model with a flattened Antarctica (which has some [high elevation mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinson_Massif)).  

I [investigated heat transfer](jesdumas.github.io/atm559/dumas_atm559_hw4.pdf) in the ocean using the [Large Ensemble Community Project](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/LENS/). 

For my final project, I chose to teach myself about [data assimilation](jesdumas.github.io/atm559/dumas_atms559project.pdf).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jesdumas/jesdumas.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
